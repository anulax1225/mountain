Purpose & context
Anulax is developing a comprehensive 360° panoramic photo editor and virtual tour creation platform using Laravel as the backend API and Vue.js with Inertia.js for the frontend. The application enables users to create interactive virtual tours by compositing panoramic photos and adding navigation hotspots between images. The project uses Three.js for 3D rendering and panoramic display, with a complex data hierarchy where users create projects containing scenes (organizational groupings for images representing the same physical location), which contain panoramic images and interactive hotspots for navigation.
The platform targets creative professionals and organizations needing immersive virtual tour capabilities, with a design aesthetic inspired by game studios and 3D asset marketplaces rather than corporate applications. Anulax switched from Alpine to Laravel's basic Vue template (without auth) and emphasizes using modern tools including shadcn/vue components with zinc theme, lucide-vue icons, and Tailwind CSS for styling.
Current state
The application has evolved into a fully functional virtual tour editor with comprehensive hotspot functionality. The Three.js canvas now operates in an immersive full-viewport mode with floating UI elements including top navigation, thumbnails strips, and info panels with semi-transparent backgrounds. The hotspot system supports both view mode for navigation and edit mode for creating new hotspots, with white dot sprites, hover popovers showing image thumbnails, and raycasting for 3D position detection.
Recent enhancements include zoom functionality with OrbitControls, restored thumbnail panels for image navigation, and a dedicated hotspots management panel in edit mode. The codebase has undergone significant refactoring, extracting 36 reusable components across 7 directories and reducing code duplication by approximately 1,200 lines. Complete dark mode support has been implemented with theme management using Vue 3's Composition API and French localization across all UI components.
Key learnings & principles
Three.js hotspot positioning requires careful coordinate calculation - the critical discovery was that hotspot positioning needed multiplication by 0.95 rather than division to properly place hotspots slightly inside the sphere geometry. Raycasting with Three.js enables precise 3D position selection for hotspot placement, while Sprite objects provide automatic camera-facing behavior for consistent hotspot visibility.
Component architecture benefits significantly from systematic refactoring - extracting reusable components for common patterns like loading states, empty states, and layout elements dramatically improves maintainability. Laravel 11+ removed the AuthorizesRequests trait from the base Controller class by default, requiring manual addition for policy authorization methods. The shadcn/vue component library provides excellent dark mode support out of the box, requiring focus only on custom components for theme implementation.
Approach & patterns
Development follows a systematic component-first approach, prioritizing reusable Vue components with proper prop interfaces and event emissions. The Three.js implementation uses spherical geometry for panoramic display with sprite-based hotspot rendering and smooth fade transitions between images. Database design follows a clear hierarchy with UUID slug generation for all models and comprehensive relationship definitions.
API development emphasizes nested route structures reflecting data relationships, with explicit route definitions, comprehensive request validation, and ownership-based authorization policies. The frontend uses Inertia.js for SPA navigation while maintaining Laravel's server-side routing benefits. All UI development prioritizes mobile-first responsive design with consistent Tailwind CSS patterns and lucide-vue icons throughout.
Tools & resources
The core technology stack includes Laravel 12 with Inertia.js, Vue.js 3 with Composition API, Three.js for 3D rendering, and shadcn/vue components with zinc theme. The project uses an owl-sdk for API communication, Tailwind CSS for styling, and lucide-vue-next for iconography. Database operations utilize Laravel Sanctum for authentication, comprehensive Eloquent relationships, and slug-based routing.
Development tools include Laravel Scribe for automatic API documentation generation, comprehensive form request validation classes, and authorization policies for all models. The Three.js implementation leverages SphereGeometry, TextureLoader, Raycaster for interaction detection, OrbitControls for navigation, and Sprites for hotspot markers with proper billboarding behavior.
Other instructions
Forgot all about the alpine stuff, i changed to the laravel basic vue template (without auth) instead.
